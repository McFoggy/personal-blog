Today I just opened a new site to share my OSS contributions: [oss.brouillard.fr](http://oss.brouillard.fr).

This site will allow me to use `fr.brouillard.oss` as groupId for my oss maven projects (due to maven cenral restrictions). Talking about contributions, I did the site specially to publish my new little project called _[OuiOui LoginModule](http://oss.brouillard.fr/projects/ouiouiloginmodule/)_.
Do not hesitate to use it for your load tests. 

Fork, open issues, ... do whatever you want, it's OSS !
