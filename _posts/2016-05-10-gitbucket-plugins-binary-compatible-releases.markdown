Since more than a year now I started participating in [gitbucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) ; a scala based open source git platform offering some features like github or bitbucket.

In order to ensure compatibility with the new [4.x](https://gitbucket.github.io/gitbucket-news/gitbucket/2016/04/30/gitbucket-3.14-and-4.0.html) release I had also to release the plugins I contributed:

- [gitbucket-announce-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket-plugins/gitbucket-announce-plugin) was released in [1.4.0](https://github.com/gitbucket-plugins/gitbucket-announce-plugin/releases/tag/1.4.0) version,
- while [gitbucket-h2-backup-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket-plugins/gitbucket-h2-backup-plugin) was released in version [1.2.0](https://github.com/gitbucket-plugins/gitbucket-h2-backup-plugin/releases/tag/1.2.0)

If only I had more time for this scala stuff...
