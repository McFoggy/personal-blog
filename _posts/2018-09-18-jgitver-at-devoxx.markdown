This is a great news that I am quite proud to share with you.

I will present [jgitver](https://jgitver.github.io/) during a quickie at [Devoxx 2018](https://dvbe18.confinabox.com/speaker/matthieu_brouillard) next November 2018 in Antwerp.
In preparation of that event I started to refresh the main site https://jgitver.github.io/

I'll demonstrate jgitver usage a bit like I did at [Bordeaux JUG](http://bordeauxjug.org/) last June (english [slides](https://slides.com/mcfoggy/jgitver_en))

Feel free to comment or to provide me some feedback.
