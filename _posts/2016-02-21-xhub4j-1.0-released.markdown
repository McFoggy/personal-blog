For a an incoming professional project, I needed to be able to secure `webhooks`.
To achieve that I published [xhub4j](https://github.com/McFoggy/xhub4j) a library to compute, generate and consume http signature headers [Ã  la github `X-Hub-Signature`](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#delivery-headers), example of generated header:
```
X-Hub-Signature:sha1=fa0902542a12dbf43ef081c0cc4794fd438e172d
```

The library comes in 3 sub projects depending on your need:

- [xhub4j-core](https://github.com/McFoggy/xhub4j#xhub4j-core): provide the core API to generate the headers
- [xhub4j-servlet](https://github.com/McFoggy/xhub4j#xhub4j-servlet): jee servlet filter able to control jee web resources
- [xhub4j-jaxrs-client](https://github.com/McFoggy/xhub4j#xhub4j-jaxrs-client): jaxrs client extensions to automatically generate the signature headers depending on the content sent.

I'll also propose an extension to [gitbucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) to integrate those webhook header signatures.

Feel free to comment.
