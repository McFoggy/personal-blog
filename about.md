My name is Matthieu Brouillard.

I am a passionate Java developer since many years.

In fact I work as "Software architect" at AGFA HCIS near Bordeaux, France.

But that's not all, I am also acting as University professor at [ENSEIRB](http://www.enseirb-matmeca.fr/), trying to transmit my knowledge & passion of JEE to my students.

And when I am not having fun time with my wife and my two children, I try also to participate in the OSS community.
